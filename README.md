# MunchMatch
The main purpose of our project is to aid users who are indecisive about what to eat. We will create a tool that makes it easy for people to find places to eat near them.

# What does this project do?
The project is aiming to provide functionality for locating restaurants that are linked to Google Maps by selecting or randomizing food category options via the application named MunchMatch. Users would be able to gain a wonderful experience of choosing preferred restaurants from elegant and user-friendly interfaces.

# Why is this project useful?
The goal of this project is to provide restaurant choices when users are struggling with making decisions. Restaurants generated from different food categories can also be ordered by distance, rate, and other properties. In the meantime, MunchMatch also supports listing the details of each restaurant.

# How to deploy and run this project?
TBD

# Available versions
A1 provides the basic functions including selecting preferred or random food options, listing restaurant details obtained from Google Maps, and linking to Google Maps. In future versions (A2/A3), some new features such as sharing particular restaurants with friends could be added.
